### overview
This is my **undergraduate graduation project** from the School of Cyberspace Security at Shandong University,under the guidance of **Dr. Wang Wei**.

The content can be divided into two parts.In the first part, I successfully implemented the **Small-AES** scheme based on the specifications provided by Cid et al. in their paper [Small Scale Variants of the AES](https://iacr.org/archive/fse2005/35570143/35570143.pdf)(FSE 2005).<br>
In the second part,I focuses on the **truncated differential route** introduced by Dunkelman et al. in their paper [Improved Single-Key Attacks on 8-Round AES-192 and AES-256](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/322.pdf)(ASIACRYPT 2010).I performed practical analysis on the Small-AES implementation to explore its differential characteristics, aiming to identify any similarities or potential attack vectors that may exist in AES. By applying the Truncated Differential Cryptanalysis technique, we aimed to uncover any weaknesses or security implications that the Small-AES scheme might have.
