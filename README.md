# Small-AES-truncated_differential
First,I implemented the **Small-AES** scheme proposed by Cid et al. in *Small Scale Variants of the AES* published in FSE 2005.Secondly,we apply the truncated differential route in *Improved Single-Key Attacks on 8-Round AES-192 and AES-256* proposed by  Dunkelman et al. at ASIACRYPT 2010 to the analysis of Small-AES.
